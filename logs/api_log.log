Using a computer, these categories were grouped into 2-12 stages in every possible combination, so a total of 146,975 logical classifications were generated. The optimal model was selected for each group of classifications with equal stage number, thus giving the greatest prognostic information on 5-year survival according to the Akaike criterion. The results showed that (1) 13% of the total classifications, including 85% of the 3-stage classifications, were better than the Dukes system in predicting our patients\' outcomes; (2) the T-level was a stage-determinant even more important than the N-level; and (3) major changes in prognosis occurred at more advanced stages than the classical "turning points". We conclude that in order to find an optimal staging of cancer, systematic computer-aided search through all the possible classifications is necessary, using the appropriate database. \n4\tIntraoperative assessment of regional myocardial perfusion using quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography: an experimental evaluation. To test the hypothesis that myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to quantitate regional myocardial flow in the arrested heart at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution, data were acquired in 13 dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass. Different degrees of stenosis were placed in random order on the left anterior descending coronary artery. For each stenosis, myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed by injecting sonicated albumin microbubbles into the cross-clamped aortic root at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution. The resultant echocardiographic images were analyzed on an off-line computer. Background-subtracted time-intensity plots were generated, and an exponential function, f(t) = Ce-alpha t + De- beta t, was applied to each plot. Variables that reflected the total number of microbubbles entering the coronary artery bed, such as the area under the curve and the peak height of the curve, correlated best with radiolabeled microsphere-measured myocardial flow (r = 0.92 and r = 0.91, respectively). Variables that reflected the appearance of contrast microbubbles in the myocardium, such as the initial slope and the slope at 1 s, also had a good correlation with myocardial flow (r = 0.84 and r = 0.89, respectively). Variables that reflected the washout of contrast medium from the myocardium, such as the slope of the descending portion of the curve, had only a fair correlation with myocardial flow (r = 0.65). In six dogs, the technique of injecting contrast medium into the cross-clamped aortic root was also examined. Although continuous infusion of contrast medium produced smaller perturbations in mean aortic and distal left anterior descending artery pressures compared with a bolus injection (p less than 0.01), the correlation between the variables of the time-intensity curves and flow was equally close with both techniques. It is concluded that it is possible to quantitate myocardial flow by using myocardial contrast echocardiography at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution in dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass. The implementation of this technique in humans might be useful in guiding the sequence of graft placement and thereby improving myocardial preservation during coronary artery bypass operations. \n1\tEfficacy of interferons on bowenoid papulosis and other precancerous lesions. Preliminary results of an open randomized trial of recombinant interferon gamma in patients suffering from bowenoid papulosis are described. Recombinant interferon gamma was given subcutaneously to 12 patients at a daily dose of 4 X 10(6) I.U. by injection. Four patients each were assigned to one of three treatment groups consisting of continuous therapy (group A) with three subcutaneous injections per week for 13 weeks; intermittent block therapy (group B) with four six-week cycles consisting of five injections on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 of each cycle; and intermittent single-dose therapy (group C) with six four-week cycles consisting of only one subcutaneous injection on day one of each cycle. At the twenty-sixth week after onset of therapy, complete responses were seen in three of four patients of treatment group A, whereas in the treatment groups B and C only one patient, respectively, responded partially. These results suggest that in contrast to condylomata acuminata bowenoid papulosis lesions respond better to continuous than to intermittent interferon gamma injections.\n\nfile_path: data\\train_data\\train_data.txt\n\nSurgery should be utilized only if dilation therapy fails to achieve a satisfactory response. \n1\tAn unusual epidural, vascular spinal lipoma in a 3-year-old child: a case report and review of the literature. Epidural lipomas are usually benign tumors affecting the spinal cord. We report the unusual presentation of a cervicothoracic spinal lipoma associated with a cervical dysraphism in a young boy. Diagnostic options using magnetic resonance imaging and gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid are discussed as a pathway to early diagnosis of these and other occult spinal lesions. \n4\tQuantitative assessment of ultrasonic myocardial reflectivity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between acoustic properties of the myocardium and magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An on-line radio frequency analysis system was used to obtain quantitative operator-independent measurements of the integrated backscatter signal of the ventricular septum and posterior free wall in 25 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 25 normal age-matched control subjects. The integrated values of the radio frequency signal were normalized for the pericardial interface and expressed in percent. Tissue reflectivity was significantly increased in the hypertrophied ventricular septum, as well as in the nonhypertrophied posterior free wall, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (58 +/- 15% and 37 +/- 12%, respectively) compared with values in normal subjects (33 +/- 10% and 18 +/- 5%, respectively; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, measurements of reflectivity of the septum or posterior free wall, or both, were beyond 2 SD of normal values in greater than 90% of the patients and were also abnormal in each of the five study patients who had only mild and localized left ventricular hypertrophy. No correlation was identified between myocardial tissue reflectivity and left ventricular wall thickness in the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (correlation coefficient r = 0.4; p = NS). These findings demonstrate that myocardial reflectivity is abnormal in most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is largely independent of the magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, quantitative analysis of ultrasonic reflectivity can differentiate patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from normal subjects independently of clinical features and conventional echocardiographic measurements. \n4\tSignificance of discordant ST alternans in ventricular fibrillation. With the use of epicardial mapping, we investigated the electrical alternans of the ST segment during acute myocardial ischemia and studied the difference in ST alternans between dogs with resultant ventricular fibrillation and those without it. During the 7-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery below its first diagonal branch, 60 epicardial unipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously at 1-minute intervals by a computerized mapping system. ST alternans was found in the eight dogs we observed. The amplitude of ST alternans (difference in the ST segment elevation of two consecutive electrograms) was greater in dogs with ventricular fibrillation (n = 4) than in those without it (n = 4) (3.92 +/- 1.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.49 mV, p less than 0.05). Three of the four dogs with ventricular fibrillation demonstrated discordant ST alternans (i.e., adjacent leads were out of phase). Results from the present study indicate that an increased amplitude and discordance of ST alternans during acute myocardial ischemia are related to ventricular fibrillation and act as indicators of time and spatial unevenness of ventricular repolarization. \n5\tFuture needs for ERCP: incidence of conditions leading to bile duct obstruction and requirements for diagnostic and therapeutic biliary procedures. Although the development of endoscopic methods of treatment for biliary obstruction has proceeded rapidly in recent years, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) services are patchily distributed. A recent survey by the British Society of Gastroenterology has shown that almost half the district general hospitals questioned did not have a sphincterotomy service available locally. To assess the level of provision required, two investigations have been undertaken. Firstly, an epidemiological study of bile duct obstruction has been carried out in the South Western Region. Secondly, the actual surgical and endoscopic workload in treating obstructive jaundice has been analysed in two health districts. Using present incidence and treatment rates at least 50 ERCPs per 100,000 of the population per year are estimated to be required in the future. Surgical treatment rates can be expected to fall as the number of therapeutic ERCPs increases.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: classification number for Retained endobronchial foreign body removal facilitated by steroid therapy of an obstructing, inflammatory polyp\nAnswer: '}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

We report our results with nine patients treated by needle aspiration and bolstered pressure sutures applied over both aspects of the cyst for 1 week. Treatment resulted in complete resolution with no recurrence of the lesion in any of the patients. This procedure is simple, does not require an operating room setting, and is more comfortable and more acceptable aesthetically by the patient. \n5\tColonic stenoses: use of oral barium when retrograde flow is completely obstructed on barium enema studies. Forty patients with complete obstruction to retrograde barium flow on barium enema examinations, without clinical or radiographic evidence of obstruction, were studied further with orally administered barium in the same session. All patients had undergone aborted double-contrast barium enema studies and had received antispasmodics intramuscularly before the examination. The authors describe the technique, as well as the clinical and radiologic findings, that allows the safe ingestion of oral barium in patients with stenotic lesions of the colon. In all patients, oral barium passed through the small bowel and the stenotic site in an average of 148 minutes, with no complications. In seven patients, there were synchronous lesions in the colon and small bowel, and the findings were determined better with oral barium studies in 19 patients. If a barium enema study is done and retrograde passage of barium is obstructed by a lesion in the left side of the colon, additional diagnostic information can be obtained by giving the patients oral barium. This practice is safe if precise criteria are applied. \n5\tRapid sequence anesthesia induction for emergency intubation. Emergency intubations are done for a variety of reasons in the emergency department (ED). In some patients, a rapid, controlled induction of anesthesia is useful to facilitate intubation and to reduce the complications of intubation. This is referred to a rapid sequence induction (RSI) in the anesthesia literature. Atropine, thiopental, fentanyl, diazepam, ketamine, vecuronium, succinylcholine, other drugs and their applications for RSI are described. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of RSI in the airway management of ED patients. Nineteen pediatric patients requiring emergency intubation were intubated using RSI with vecuronium and thiopental. Actual intubation difficulty using RSI was significantly less than the anticipated intubation difficulty without RSI. There were no complications caused by intubation or RSI that had a significant impact on patient outcome. We feel that a sedative in combination with vecuronium represents the most optimal means of achieving RSI in the ED setting. Although the induction of general anesthesia is best done by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians are often the most experienced physicians immediately available to manage an airway in a critical emergency. An objective protocol such as that described will make it easier for emergency physicians to perform this procedure when needed. \n1\tPapillary carcinoma of the thyroid with mucoepidermoid features. The significance and differential diagnoses of signet-ring cells found in the fine-needle aspirate of metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma from the thyroid are reported and discussed. The primary tumor occurred in a 35-year-old man, who had a history of neck irradiation during his childhood. Despite postoperative treatment with 60 Gy external radiation and 1,200 mCi 131I, the patient has at present--12 years after the initial operation--progressive disease with local recurrence in the neck as well as lung metastases. \n1\tTreatment of fallopian tube carcinoma with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube is uncommon and is often treated using regimens active in ovarian carcinoma. Evidence is scant that such therapies benefit patients with fallopian tube carcinoma. Between December 1979 and July 1988, we treated 18 patients who had adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube with the combination of cisplatin (50 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) administered intravenously on 1 day every 28 days. Histologic confirmation of fallopian tube carcinoma was obtained before entry in the study. Three patients had stage I disease, five had stage II, nine had stage III, and one had stage IV. Sixteen patients received the combination therapy as first-line treatment after cytoreductive surgery, and two patients received it for recurrent carcinoma. Seven patients had clinically measurable disease at the start of therapy.\n\nfile_path: data\\train_data\\train_data.txt\n\nSuch extruded solid fragments lodge in bronchi of the same or opposite lung with resulting acute obstruction of airways. Intraoperative bronchial aspiration of hydatid material was seen in 7 patients with ruptured hydatid cysts of the lung, either primary or secondary to transdiaphragmatic extension of liver hydatids. The first clinical sign can be unexplained difficulty in ventilation. Effective management consists of prompt exposure of the stem bronchus on the operative side, with bronchotomy for suction retrieval of escaped solid fragments of the parasite. \n5\tLeiomyosarcoma of the larynx: emergency laryngectomy. Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx is extremely rare. A patient with respiratory obstruction due to such a tumour is presented. This was originally misdiagnosed as hysteria. The treatment of choice was an emergency laryngectomy. \n5\tResolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. \n5\tAcute respiratory failure caused by pulmonary vasculitis after L-tryptophan ingestion. This report describes two women who presented with severe respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the fall of 1989. Both required prolonged assisted ventilation because of severe shunt physiology. Open lung biopsies on admission revealed a small vessel vasculitis as the sole morphologic abnormality in both patients. Both responded to high dose corticosteroids. Neither patient exhibited evidence of systemic vasculitis, and neither had serologic evidence of an immune disorder. Common to both patients was ingestion of L-tryptophan. One patient exhibited several features of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The other patient did not appear to have the syndrome, but the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and initiation of L-tryptophan treatment was striking. The presentation of these patients alters our notions concerning the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by this agent, and the response to methylprednisolone supports its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder. \n1\tOncogenes and suppressor genes: their involvement in colon cancer [editorial] Abnormalities in oncogenes, which are broadly classified into viral and cellular oncogenes, and suppressor genes appear critical for the development of colon cancer. Cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation when they become activated by point mutation, translocation, amplification, or loss of regulator sequences. The properties of the oncoproteins, the proteins encoded by oncogenes which are essential for carcinogenesis, are unclear. Suppressor genes normally suppress the tumorigenic phenotype by keeping the growth of cells in check; it is their inactivation that contributes to malignant transformation. Development of colon cancer appears to take place by stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic alterations during the progression from normal colon to adenoma and carcinoma. Activation of ras, an early event in this sequence, is found in 50% of colon cancers; overexpression of c-myc is found in approximately 80%. Inactivation of suppressor genes, which occurs during later stages, is noted in greater than 70% of tumors. A current model of colonic tumorigenesis is presented. \n5\tUrinary tract dilatation in pregnancy. Right-sided ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation was observed during routine uterine ultrasonographic examination at 30 weeks' gestation. This continued to progress with the renal pelvis measuring 8.9 cm in diameter at 35 weeks, leading to early delivery. Renal function remained normal and these changes resolved completely after delivery. \n5\tIndependence of pressure reactivity from pressure levels in Tecumseh, Michigan. The relation between blood pressure level and reactivity to mental arithmetic and isometric exercise was investigated in 169 men and 120 women (average age, 32.3 years) from the village of Tecumseh, Mich. In the entire population, the correlation between baseline blood pressure and blood pressure response to both stressors was not significant.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Retained endobronchial foreign body removal facilitated by steroid therapy of an obstructing, inflammatory polyp\nAnswer: "}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

We report our results with nine patients treated by needle aspiration and bolstered pressure sutures applied over both aspects of the cyst for 1 week. Treatment resulted in complete resolution with no recurrence of the lesion in any of the patients. This procedure is simple, does not require an operating room setting, and is more comfortable and more acceptable aesthetically by the patient. \n5\tColonic stenoses: use of oral barium when retrograde flow is completely obstructed on barium enema studies. Forty patients with complete obstruction to retrograde barium flow on barium enema examinations, without clinical or radiographic evidence of obstruction, were studied further with orally administered barium in the same session. All patients had undergone aborted double-contrast barium enema studies and had received antispasmodics intramuscularly before the examination. The authors describe the technique, as well as the clinical and radiologic findings, that allows the safe ingestion of oral barium in patients with stenotic lesions of the colon. In all patients, oral barium passed through the small bowel and the stenotic site in an average of 148 minutes, with no complications. In seven patients, there were synchronous lesions in the colon and small bowel, and the findings were determined better with oral barium studies in 19 patients. If a barium enema study is done and retrograde passage of barium is obstructed by a lesion in the left side of the colon, additional diagnostic information can be obtained by giving the patients oral barium. This practice is safe if precise criteria are applied. \n5\tRapid sequence anesthesia induction for emergency intubation. Emergency intubations are done for a variety of reasons in the emergency department (ED). In some patients, a rapid, controlled induction of anesthesia is useful to facilitate intubation and to reduce the complications of intubation. This is referred to a rapid sequence induction (RSI) in the anesthesia literature. Atropine, thiopental, fentanyl, diazepam, ketamine, vecuronium, succinylcholine, other drugs and their applications for RSI are described. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of RSI in the airway management of ED patients. Nineteen pediatric patients requiring emergency intubation were intubated using RSI with vecuronium and thiopental. Actual intubation difficulty using RSI was significantly less than the anticipated intubation difficulty without RSI. There were no complications caused by intubation or RSI that had a significant impact on patient outcome. We feel that a sedative in combination with vecuronium represents the most optimal means of achieving RSI in the ED setting. Although the induction of general anesthesia is best done by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians are often the most experienced physicians immediately available to manage an airway in a critical emergency. An objective protocol such as that described will make it easier for emergency physicians to perform this procedure when needed. \n1\tPapillary carcinoma of the thyroid with mucoepidermoid features. The significance and differential diagnoses of signet-ring cells found in the fine-needle aspirate of metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma from the thyroid are reported and discussed. The primary tumor occurred in a 35-year-old man, who had a history of neck irradiation during his childhood. Despite postoperative treatment with 60 Gy external radiation and 1,200 mCi 131I, the patient has at present--12 years after the initial operation--progressive disease with local recurrence in the neck as well as lung metastases. \n1\tTreatment of fallopian tube carcinoma with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube is uncommon and is often treated using regimens active in ovarian carcinoma. Evidence is scant that such therapies benefit patients with fallopian tube carcinoma. Between December 1979 and July 1988, we treated 18 patients who had adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube with the combination of cisplatin (50 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) administered intravenously on 1 day every 28 days. Histologic confirmation of fallopian tube carcinoma was obtained before entry in the study. Three patients had stage I disease, five had stage II, nine had stage III, and one had stage IV. Sixteen patients received the combination therapy as first-line treatment after cytoreductive surgery, and two patients received it for recurrent carcinoma. Seven patients had clinically measurable disease at the start of therapy.\n\nfile_path: data\\train_data\\train_data.txt\n\nSuch extruded solid fragments lodge in bronchi of the same or opposite lung with resulting acute obstruction of airways. Intraoperative bronchial aspiration of hydatid material was seen in 7 patients with ruptured hydatid cysts of the lung, either primary or secondary to transdiaphragmatic extension of liver hydatids. The first clinical sign can be unexplained difficulty in ventilation. Effective management consists of prompt exposure of the stem bronchus on the operative side, with bronchotomy for suction retrieval of escaped solid fragments of the parasite. \n5\tLeiomyosarcoma of the larynx: emergency laryngectomy. Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx is extremely rare. A patient with respiratory obstruction due to such a tumour is presented. This was originally misdiagnosed as hysteria. The treatment of choice was an emergency laryngectomy. \n5\tResolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. \n5\tAcute respiratory failure caused by pulmonary vasculitis after L-tryptophan ingestion. This report describes two women who presented with severe respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the fall of 1989. Both required prolonged assisted ventilation because of severe shunt physiology. Open lung biopsies on admission revealed a small vessel vasculitis as the sole morphologic abnormality in both patients. Both responded to high dose corticosteroids. Neither patient exhibited evidence of systemic vasculitis, and neither had serologic evidence of an immune disorder. Common to both patients was ingestion of L-tryptophan. One patient exhibited several features of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The other patient did not appear to have the syndrome, but the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and initiation of L-tryptophan treatment was striking. The presentation of these patients alters our notions concerning the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by this agent, and the response to methylprednisolone supports its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder. \n1\tOncogenes and suppressor genes: their involvement in colon cancer [editorial] Abnormalities in oncogenes, which are broadly classified into viral and cellular oncogenes, and suppressor genes appear critical for the development of colon cancer. Cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation when they become activated by point mutation, translocation, amplification, or loss of regulator sequences. The properties of the oncoproteins, the proteins encoded by oncogenes which are essential for carcinogenesis, are unclear. Suppressor genes normally suppress the tumorigenic phenotype by keeping the growth of cells in check; it is their inactivation that contributes to malignant transformation. Development of colon cancer appears to take place by stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic alterations during the progression from normal colon to adenoma and carcinoma. Activation of ras, an early event in this sequence, is found in 50% of colon cancers; overexpression of c-myc is found in approximately 80%. Inactivation of suppressor genes, which occurs during later stages, is noted in greater than 70% of tumors. A current model of colonic tumorigenesis is presented. \n5\tUrinary tract dilatation in pregnancy. Right-sided ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation was observed during routine uterine ultrasonographic examination at 30 weeks' gestation. This continued to progress with the renal pelvis measuring 8.9 cm in diameter at 35 weeks, leading to early delivery. Renal function remained normal and these changes resolved completely after delivery. \n5\tIndependence of pressure reactivity from pressure levels in Tecumseh, Michigan. The relation between blood pressure level and reactivity to mental arithmetic and isometric exercise was investigated in 169 men and 120 women (average age, 32.3 years) from the village of Tecumseh, Mich. In the entire population, the correlation between baseline blood pressure and blood pressure response to both stressors was not significant.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Retained endobronchial foreign body removal facilitated by steroid therapy of an obstructing, inflammatory polyp\nAnswer: "}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

We report our results with nine patients treated by needle aspiration and bolstered pressure sutures applied over both aspects of the cyst for 1 week. Treatment resulted in complete resolution with no recurrence of the lesion in any of the patients. This procedure is simple, does not require an operating room setting, and is more comfortable and more acceptable aesthetically by the patient. \n5\tColonic stenoses: use of oral barium when retrograde flow is completely obstructed on barium enema studies. Forty patients with complete obstruction to retrograde barium flow on barium enema examinations, without clinical or radiographic evidence of obstruction, were studied further with orally administered barium in the same session. All patients had undergone aborted double-contrast barium enema studies and had received antispasmodics intramuscularly before the examination. The authors describe the technique, as well as the clinical and radiologic findings, that allows the safe ingestion of oral barium in patients with stenotic lesions of the colon. In all patients, oral barium passed through the small bowel and the stenotic site in an average of 148 minutes, with no complications. In seven patients, there were synchronous lesions in the colon and small bowel, and the findings were determined better with oral barium studies in 19 patients. If a barium enema study is done and retrograde passage of barium is obstructed by a lesion in the left side of the colon, additional diagnostic information can be obtained by giving the patients oral barium. This practice is safe if precise criteria are applied. \n5\tRapid sequence anesthesia induction for emergency intubation. Emergency intubations are done for a variety of reasons in the emergency department (ED). In some patients, a rapid, controlled induction of anesthesia is useful to facilitate intubation and to reduce the complications of intubation. This is referred to a rapid sequence induction (RSI) in the anesthesia literature. Atropine, thiopental, fentanyl, diazepam, ketamine, vecuronium, succinylcholine, other drugs and their applications for RSI are described. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of RSI in the airway management of ED patients. Nineteen pediatric patients requiring emergency intubation were intubated using RSI with vecuronium and thiopental. Actual intubation difficulty using RSI was significantly less than the anticipated intubation difficulty without RSI. There were no complications caused by intubation or RSI that had a significant impact on patient outcome. We feel that a sedative in combination with vecuronium represents the most optimal means of achieving RSI in the ED setting. Although the induction of general anesthesia is best done by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians are often the most experienced physicians immediately available to manage an airway in a critical emergency. An objective protocol such as that described will make it easier for emergency physicians to perform this procedure when needed. \n1\tPapillary carcinoma of the thyroid with mucoepidermoid features. The significance and differential diagnoses of signet-ring cells found in the fine-needle aspirate of metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma from the thyroid are reported and discussed. The primary tumor occurred in a 35-year-old man, who had a history of neck irradiation during his childhood. Despite postoperative treatment with 60 Gy external radiation and 1,200 mCi 131I, the patient has at present--12 years after the initial operation--progressive disease with local recurrence in the neck as well as lung metastases. \n1\tTreatment of fallopian tube carcinoma with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube is uncommon and is often treated using regimens active in ovarian carcinoma. Evidence is scant that such therapies benefit patients with fallopian tube carcinoma. Between December 1979 and July 1988, we treated 18 patients who had adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube with the combination of cisplatin (50 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) administered intravenously on 1 day every 28 days. Histologic confirmation of fallopian tube carcinoma was obtained before entry in the study. Three patients had stage I disease, five had stage II, nine had stage III, and one had stage IV. Sixteen patients received the combination therapy as first-line treatment after cytoreductive surgery, and two patients received it for recurrent carcinoma. Seven patients had clinically measurable disease at the start of therapy.\n\nfile_path: data\\train_data\\train_data.txt\n\nSuch extruded solid fragments lodge in bronchi of the same or opposite lung with resulting acute obstruction of airways. Intraoperative bronchial aspiration of hydatid material was seen in 7 patients with ruptured hydatid cysts of the lung, either primary or secondary to transdiaphragmatic extension of liver hydatids. The first clinical sign can be unexplained difficulty in ventilation. Effective management consists of prompt exposure of the stem bronchus on the operative side, with bronchotomy for suction retrieval of escaped solid fragments of the parasite. \n5\tLeiomyosarcoma of the larynx: emergency laryngectomy. Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx is extremely rare. A patient with respiratory obstruction due to such a tumour is presented. This was originally misdiagnosed as hysteria. The treatment of choice was an emergency laryngectomy. \n5\tResolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. \n5\tAcute respiratory failure caused by pulmonary vasculitis after L-tryptophan ingestion. This report describes two women who presented with severe respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the fall of 1989. Both required prolonged assisted ventilation because of severe shunt physiology. Open lung biopsies on admission revealed a small vessel vasculitis as the sole morphologic abnormality in both patients. Both responded to high dose corticosteroids. Neither patient exhibited evidence of systemic vasculitis, and neither had serologic evidence of an immune disorder. Common to both patients was ingestion of L-tryptophan. One patient exhibited several features of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The other patient did not appear to have the syndrome, but the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and initiation of L-tryptophan treatment was striking. The presentation of these patients alters our notions concerning the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by this agent, and the response to methylprednisolone supports its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder. \n1\tOncogenes and suppressor genes: their involvement in colon cancer [editorial] Abnormalities in oncogenes, which are broadly classified into viral and cellular oncogenes, and suppressor genes appear critical for the development of colon cancer. Cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation when they become activated by point mutation, translocation, amplification, or loss of regulator sequences. The properties of the oncoproteins, the proteins encoded by oncogenes which are essential for carcinogenesis, are unclear. Suppressor genes normally suppress the tumorigenic phenotype by keeping the growth of cells in check; it is their inactivation that contributes to malignant transformation. Development of colon cancer appears to take place by stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic alterations during the progression from normal colon to adenoma and carcinoma. Activation of ras, an early event in this sequence, is found in 50% of colon cancers; overexpression of c-myc is found in approximately 80%. Inactivation of suppressor genes, which occurs during later stages, is noted in greater than 70% of tumors. A current model of colonic tumorigenesis is presented. \n5\tUrinary tract dilatation in pregnancy. Right-sided ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation was observed during routine uterine ultrasonographic examination at 30 weeks' gestation. This continued to progress with the renal pelvis measuring 8.9 cm in diameter at 35 weeks, leading to early delivery. Renal function remained normal and these changes resolved completely after delivery. \n5\tIndependence of pressure reactivity from pressure levels in Tecumseh, Michigan. The relation between blood pressure level and reactivity to mental arithmetic and isometric exercise was investigated in 169 men and 120 women (average age, 32.3 years) from the village of Tecumseh, Mich. In the entire population, the correlation between baseline blood pressure and blood pressure response to both stressors was not significant.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Retained endobronchial foreign body removal facilitated by steroid therapy of an obstructing, inflammatory polyp\nAnswer: "}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Most patients received peribulbar anesthesia and underwent removal of the epithelium prior to laser ablation. A majority of patients had a reduction in the amount of corneal scarring and approximately half had improved visual acuity. No intraocular reaction or changes in endothelial counts were seen, and some patients avoided the need for penetrating keratoplasty. Reepithelialization usually occurred within 4 or 5 days and we noted no significant scarring secondary to use of the laser. It was difficult to eliminate preexisting irregular astigmatism despite the use of surface modulators, such as methylcellulose. A hyperopic shift secondary to corneal flattening was encountered in approximately 50% of the patients. A combination of myopic ablation, followed immediately by a secondary hyperopic steepening, may minimize this refractive change. The 193-nm excimer laser is an effective new tool in the treatment of selected patients with superficial corneal opacity from a variety of conditions. \n1\tCutaneous manifestations of postthymic T cell malignancies: description of five clinicopathologic subtypes. This study was undertaken to identify the cutaneous manifestations among different prognostic subgroups of postthymic T cell malignancies. Cutaneous involvement was demonstrated in 43 of 88 cases. We recognized five clinicopathologic subtypes: type I, classical cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) or mycosis fungoides, six cases; type II, primary large cell type CTCL, Ki-1 antigen (Ki-1+ or Ki-1-), seven cases; type III, primary angioinvasive T cell lymphoma, three cases; type IV, human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I+) adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), eight cases; type V, secondary cutaneous involvement by peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTL), 19 cases. Primary CTCL and ATL tend to involve papillary dermis with or without epidermotropism, whereas PTL and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma predominantly affect skin adnexae, vessels, and subcutis. Cutaneous lesions in type V PTL are heterogeneous and may be confused with panniculitis, vasculitis, or an eczematous eruption. Classic CTCL, Ki-1+ lymphoma, and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma have a chronic course, whereas ATL, Ki-1- large cell lymphoma, and PTL are clinically aggressive. \n3\tBacterial meningitis: an update. Antibiotics and improvements in supportive care have greatly reduced the mortality from bacterial meningitis. Nevertheless, the incidence of neurodevelopmental sequelae remains unacceptably high. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol remain the standard for antimicrobial therapy against which other agents must be compared. A number of adjunct therapies are being investigated for their possible effectiveness in reducing hearing loss and other neurologic effects of this disease. There continues to be a need for carefully performed follow-up studies to assess any possible benefit of these agents. A significant percentage of children surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis have obvious or subtle neurodevelopmental deficits. The role of the pediatric neurologist should not end with management of acute problems such as seizures but should be expanded to aid in close developmental monitoring of these high-risk children. \n5\tLocal-regional breast cancer recurrence following mastectomy. Local-regional recurrence patterns were investigated in 1392 patients with breast cancer. Primary treatment for all patients included a mastectomy. Nine hundred seventeen patients had negative nodes and did not receive systemic therapy. Four hundred seventy-five patients had node metastases and were randomized to receive different combinations of chemoendocrine therapy. Follow-up ranged between 5 and 16 years. Two hundred thirty (25.8%) node-negative patients have had recurrences, with the initial recurrence being local-regional in 9.2%. Two hundred forty-two (50.9%) node-positive patients have had recurrences, with the initial recurrence being local-regional in 17.1%. Larger tumors and more extensive node involvement were associated with more first local-regional recurrences. The relative percent of first local-regional recurrence among patients in whom cancer recurred was similar for node-negative and node-positive patients (35.4% and 33.5%, respectively). In 63.6% of patients in whom cancer recurred, first local-regional recurrence were distant.\n\nfile_path: data\\train_data\\train_data.txt\n\nA safe procedure for thin cutaneous melanoma. We analyzed the results at 8 years of an international, randomized, prospective study carried out by the World Health Organization Melanoma Programme aimed at evaluating the efficacy of 1-cm-margin excision of primary melanomas not thicker than 2 mm. Data for 612 patients were assessable; 305 were randomized to receive 1-cm-margin excision and 307 to receive wide excision (margins of greater than or equal to 3 cm). The major prognostic criteria were similar in the two groups. Breslow thickness was 0.99 mm in the narrow excision group and 1.02 mm in the wide excision group. Disease-free and overall survival rates (mean follow-up period, 90 months) were similar in the two groups. Only four patients had a local recurrence as a first relapse. All underwent narrow excision, and each had primary melanomas thicker than 1 mm. \n4\tAcute changes in the dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid system during experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Early changes in intracranial pressure (ICP), ICP volume index, and resistance to absorption of cerebrospinal fluid induced by experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage were studied in cats. After SAH, the ICP was slightly elevated, and there was a decrease in the buffering capacity of the intracranial space and a sharp rise in outflow resistance. During infusion of blood into the cisterna magna with a constant infusion rate, an extensive increase in ICP could be demonstrated in contrast to the infusion of saline, which caused only slight elevation of ICP. Furthermore, during blood infusion, the ICP level did not reach a plateau phase of pressure, as was demonstrated during infusion of saline. It is suggested that the marked increase in ICP during blood infusion into the subarachnoid space is caused by intracranial volume loading and the simultaneous increase in cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance. It is concluded that the reported relationship between increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and increased ICP supports the hypothesis of a strong increase in ICP during subarachnoid hemorrhage in human subjects. \n5\tEffects of acute alcohol intake on tolerance to hypotension. The specific aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that intoxication with alcohol results in poor tolerance to hemorrhage. This was evaluated on the basis of blood pressure, cardiac output respiratory rate, blood flow to organs, and survival for 4 hr after hemorrhage. Four groups of six swine per group were used (control, intoxicated, hemorrhage, and intoxicated-hemorrhage). The results revealed that blood alcohol concentrations near 0.1% greatly reduced tolerance to hemorrhage. Intoxicated animals subjected to hemorrhage were unable to maintain an adequate cardiac output, blood pressure, or respiratory rate to sustain life. Pigs tolerated higher blood alcohol concentrations, up to 0.35%, when not exposed to hemorrhage. Also, unintoxicated pigs were able to compensate for severe hemorrhage. Only one of the six pigs in the intoxicated-hemorrhage group survived for 4 hr after hemorrhage. In conclusion the body's ability to compensate and recover from hemorrhage was greatly reduced during intoxication. It is logical to assume that the ability to overcome numerous other stressors may also be reduced during intoxication. \n5\tThe malignancy-sarcoidosis syndrome. In a retrospective review of six patients with malignancy preceding sarcoidosis, we found four cases of malignant lymphoproliferative disease (LD) and one case each of ovarian cancer and breast cancer. The median interval from onset or relapse of malignancy to sarcoidosis was nine months. Of the four patients with LD, sarcoidosis appeared within six months of termination of chemotherapy for three of the patients and 15 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for the fourth patient. At the time of diagnosis of sarcoidosis, there was no clinical or pathologic evidence of malignancy in the chest. We conclude that in contradistinction to the previously described syndrome of sarcoidosis preceding LD, there exists a syndrome of sarcoidosis following malignancy with or without chemotherapy. \n1\tHilar malignancy: treatment with an expandable metallic transhepatic biliary stent. An expandable metallic transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis was used to treat 20 patients with hilar malignancy and isolated right and left intrahepatic ducts. In 12 patients, only one intrahepatic ductal system was drained; in eight patients, both systems were drained.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: classification number for Excision of limbal dermoids\nAnswer: "}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
